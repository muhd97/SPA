1. Grouping - 4 groups
assign a, a1, a2; stmt s1, s2, s3; variable v1, v2;
Select BOOLEAN such that Follows*(a1, a2) and Modifies(s1, "x") and Uses(s1, v1) and Modifies(a, v2) and Uses(5, "y") and Next(s2, s3) pattern a2("a", _) and a(v1, "x")
FALSE

2 - Cartesian Product Parallel Test //such that Uses(a3,v3) such that Uses(a4,v4) such that Uses(a5,v5) such that Uses(a6,v6) (WE dont need ANY cartesian products)
assign a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10; variable v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7,v8,v9,v10;
Select BOOLEAN such that Uses(a1, v1) such that Uses(a2,v2) such that Uses(a3,v3) such that Uses(a4,v4) such that Uses(a5,v5) such that Uses(a6,v6)
FALSE

3. Grouping - 4 groups
assign a, a1, a2; stmt s1, s2, s3; variable v1, v2; call c, k; if ifs;
Select <s1, a, a1, v2> with ifs.stmt# = s3.stmt# such that Follows*(a1, a2) and Modifies(s1, "x") and Uses(s1, v1) and Modifies(a, v2) and Uses(5, "y") and Next(s2, s3) pattern a2("a", _) and a(v1, "x") with c.procName = "yida" and k.stmt# = 25 and 5 = 5
